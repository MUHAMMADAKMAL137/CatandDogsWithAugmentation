CatandDogsWithAugmentation
In the project on the dogs-vs-cats dataset from Kaggle, you utilized various deep learning techniques, including densely connected networks, convets, and ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation, to improve model performance in image classification. Moreover, you applied the VGG16 network as the base model and fine-tuned it by adding a custom top for classification. This combination of pre-trained and custom layers led to better accuracy, showcasing your proficiency in transfer learning and model adaptation.
